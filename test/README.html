<h1 id="rust-static-blog-generator">Rust Static Blog Generator</h1>
<p>To those that think that the name of the this project is a clever reference to Jekyll, let me tell you that you're wrong. The name is in fact a reference to <a href="https://github.com/unknownloner/bashyll">bashyll</a> which is itself a reference to Jekyll. I liked the simplicity but decided that I wanted to challenge myself and rewrite it in rust for <a href="http://mdit.to">my own blog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rational">Rational</h2>
<p>Other than a personal challenge to myself, there really isn't an good reason as to why I decided to write this as opposed to using a project like bashyll. I wanted to create a simple static blog generator that would only require a single command to generate all blog pages.</p>
<h3 id="why-rust">Why Rust?</h3>
<p>The rational of bashyll was to not require an external language in order to run and only required pandoc for the markdown-to-html conversion stage. I chose rust as it is a fast systems langauge and because of its formatting features. Rust has excellent build in string formatting and the <code>strfmt</code> library takes it a step further and works as an excellent templating language.</p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to be as simple to use as possible. It will eventually have a command interface, but the end-goal is to have everything configured by a config file in the root directory of the blog project.</p>
